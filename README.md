In this project, we demonstrate use of feature maps for classifiying non-linear (sinusoidal) data. 

### Software Prerequisites:
None

### Instructions
Open the notebook "FeatureMaps.ipynb" in colab by clicking on the "Open in Colab" badge.


### Results
We create polynomial featuremaps and sinusoidal feature maps. Our data is sinusoidally distributed. We see that sinusoidal feature maps are better at fitting a sine wave to the data. Polynomials of degrees
